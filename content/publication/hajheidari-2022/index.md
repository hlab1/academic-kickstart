abstract: "Transcription factors (TFs) play a critical role in determining cell fate decisions by integrating developmental and environmental signals through binding to specific cis-regulatory modules and regulating spatio-temporal specificity of gene expression patterns. Precise identification of functional TF binding sites in time and space not only will revolutionize our understanding of regulatory networks governing cell fate decisions but is also instrumental to uncover how genetic variations cause morphological diversity or disease. In this review, we discuss recent advances in mapping TF binding sites and characterizing the various parameters underlying the complexity of binding site recognition by TFs."
