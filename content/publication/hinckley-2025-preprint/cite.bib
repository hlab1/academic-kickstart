  abstract     = {Transcription Factors (TFs) govern vast networks of gene regulation. However, TF-DNA binding and TF-gene regulation datasets are typically measured separately due to experimental constraints, making it challenging to disentangle true biological relationships from batch effects. To fill this gap, we developed DamID-seq Incorporating Transcriptomics (Dam-IT), which simultaneously captures TF-DNA binding, direct TF-gene regulation, and chromatin accessibility in the same batch of cells. Dam-IT uses a transient cell-based TF-target validation system that is scalable and flexible to many experimental designs. As proof of concept, we used Dam-IT to reveal that bZIP1 directly regulates genes by binding to DNA regions of relatively low chromatin accessibility, supporting a "Hit-and-Run" mechanism of transcription.},
