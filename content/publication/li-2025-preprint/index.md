abstract: "SQUAMOSA Promoter-Binding Protein-Like (SPL) transcription factors play vital roles in plant development and stress responses. In this study, we report a comprehensive DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis for 14 of the 16 SPL transcription factors in Arabidopsis thaliana , providing valuable insights into their DNA-binding specificities. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the target genes to reveal their convergent and diverse biological functions among SPL family proteins. Comparative analysis between the paralogs AtSPL9 and AtSPL15 revealed differences in their binding motifs, suggesting divergent regulatory functions. Additionally, we expanded our investigation to homologs of AtSPL9/15 in Zea mays (ZmSBP8/30) and Triticum aestivum (TaSPL7/13), identifying conserved and unique DNA-binding patterns across species. These findings provide key resources for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SPL transcription factors in regulating plant development and evolution across different species."
