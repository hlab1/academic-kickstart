Dr. Abbas Shojaee MD, CHDA, is a seasoned biomedical/health data scientist with over two decades of experience in medical informatics, outcomes research, and advanced analytics in the healthcare domain. His expertise spans across startups, large corporations, and academia.

Dr. Shojaee's research is centered on the challenge of causal inference in complex systems where multiple factors, players, and risks interact to create an effect or outcome. This challenge is frequently encountered in untangling healthcare outcomes and understanding complex regulatory relationships in biological systems.
With outstanding results in the healthcare domain, Dr. Shojaee has developed novel concepts and methods for causal inference. In collaboration with colleagues at Huang lab, he has successfully applied these methods to reveal regulatory relationships from massive single-cell RNAseq data, achieving significantly higher accuracy than existing methods.

Dr. Shojaee earned his doctoral degree from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2002. Over the past twenty years, he has led numerous biomedical informatics projects in academia, industry, and as an entrepreneur in the Middle East. After completing postdoctoral studies at the Center for Outcomes Research at Yale University, Dr. Shojaee joined the faculty of Yale School of Medicine in 2015.

In November 2020, Dr. Shojaee joined Huang lab to contribute his expertise to the exploration of complex regulatory networks in plant biology. With his wealth of experience and passion for advancing biomedical research, he aims to advance computational methods of biological system identification and their potential applications in precision medicine and drug discovery.
