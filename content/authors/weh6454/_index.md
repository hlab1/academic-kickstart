Will Hinckley is a Biology PhD Student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Cellular/Molecular Biology at California State University, Long Beach in 2019. Will's undergraduate research involved studying the transcriptional regulation of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana under the mentorship of Dr. Judy Brusslan. He also interned in the lab of Dr. Alison DeLong where he studied the role a protein phosphatase played in regulating Arabidopsis plant size. Will's goal is to continue studying transcriptional regulation in plants, and he hopes to expand his research into important crop species.

Will is jointly advised by Gloria Coruzzi and Carol Huang.
