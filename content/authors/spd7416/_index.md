Sean is an undergraduate senior at New York University Tandon School of Engineering and is studying computer science with a minor in biomolecular science. His background in computer science has primarily been focused on machine learning, embedded systems, and robotics, but he would like to pivot to computational biology and apply his skills to this new domain. He believes that synthetic biology will be the key to solving many of the environmental issues that society faces and this has motivated him to pursue computational biology with his degree. His research interests include modeling the cistrome within plants to allow for precise control over gene expression.
