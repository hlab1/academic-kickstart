Graeme Vissers is a Biology PhD student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. Graeme received his Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry at the University of Washington in 2020. There, he studied the surface catalytics of metal-organic-framework molecules under the mentorship of Dr. Charles Campbell, before transitioning into nitrous oxide remediation research using genetically modified plants with the advisorship of Dr. Stuart Strand. Graeme plans to study the relationship of transcriptional regulation and plant development under the co-advisorship of Carol Huang and Kenneth Birnbaum.
