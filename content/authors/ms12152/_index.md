Michelle Saavedra is a current Masters student in the department of Biology at New York
University. Saavedra plans to realize a career in Genetics upon the completion of her graduate
studies. Saavedra?s motivation for pursuing genomic studies stems from learning how to
decipher the genomic and epigenomic alterations in brain cancer to traditional therapy
treatments through past research experiences during her undergraduate career at Kean
University. Her research practicum and academic background has drawn her attention to the
importance of gene expression patterns across species and biological conditions, yet at large,
the importance of Genomic research that can dramatically improve clinical medicine and the
healthcare industry. Outside of her studies, Saavedra is a Graduate Life leader for NYU Student
life and President of Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in
Science (SACNAS).
